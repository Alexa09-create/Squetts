    <h1>Carl Gustaf Mosander</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Carl Gustaf Mosander</b> (September 10, 1797 â€“ October 15, 1858) 
	</p>
	<p>
was a Swedish chemist and mineralogist. After attending schools in Kalmar, he moved to Stockholm with his mother at the age of 12, where he became an apprentice at the Ugglan pharmacy. He qualified as a pharmacist in 1817, but his interest shifted towards medicine, enrolling at the Karolinska Institutet in 1820. He worked as a chemistry teacher at the Institute and as an assistant in the mineral collection of the Swedish Museum of Natural History. In 1836, he succeeded JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzelius as professor of chemistry and pharmacy at the Karolinska Institutet. His research on yttrium oxide led him, in 1843, to isolate the oxides of two new elements: erbium and terbium. In 1833, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The mineral mosandrite is named in his honor.
