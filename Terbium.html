    <h1>Terbium (Tb)</h1>

    <dl>
        <dt>Element Name:</dt>
        <dd>Terbium (Tb) is a chemical element belonging to the lanthanide series, a group of rare earth metals. These metals, despite their name, are not particularly scarce in the Earth's crust.</dd>

        <dt>Atomic Mass:</dt>
        <dd>158.92534 u<br>The atomic mass represents the average weight of all isotopes of an element, taking into account their natural abundance. The value of 158.92534 u indicates that terbium is one of the heavier rare earth elements.</dd>

        <dt>Atomic Number:</dt>
        <dd>65<br>The atomic number indicates the number of protons in the nucleus of a terbium atom. This places terbium in the f-block of the periodic table, among the lanthanide series metals.</dd>

        <dt>Number of Isotopes:</dt>
        <dd>Terbium has 36 known isotopes, but only Tb-159 is stable. An isotope is a variant of an element that has the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons. Radioactive isotopes of terbium are used in various scientific applications.</dd>

        <dt>Mass Number (Isotopes):</dt>
        <dd>135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 171<br>These values represent the total number of protons and neutrons in the isotopes of terbium. Tb-159 is the only stable and naturally occurring isotope.</dd>

        <dt>Melting Point:</dt>
        <dd>1356 ¬∞C (2473 ¬∞F)<br>This temperature indicates the point at which terbium transitions from a solid to a liquid state. This relatively high melting point is characteristic of many rare earth metals.</dd>

        <dt>Boiling Point:</dt>
        <dd>3230 ¬∞C (5846 ¬∞F)<br>The boiling point represents the temperature at which terbium transitions from a liquid to a gaseous state. This high value indicates that terbium remains liquid over a wide temperature range, useful in high-temperature applications.</dd>

        <dt>Density:</dt>
        <dd>8.27 g/cm¬≥<br>The density of terbium is moderate compared to other metals. This property is important when considering its use in alloys and other materials.</dd>

        <dt>Electronegativity:</dt>
        <dd>1.2 (Pauling scale)<br>Electronegativity measures the ability of an atom to attract electrons in a chemical bond. The low value of 1.2 indicates that terbium is electropositive and tends to lose electrons in chemical reactions.</dd>

        <dt>Year of Discovery:</dt>
        <dd>1843, Carl Gustaf Mosander<br>Terbium was discovered by the Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander while studying yttria, a mineral containing several rare earth elements. Its discovery contributed significantly to the understanding of this group of elements.</dd>

        <dt>Abundance:</dt>
        <dd>Terbium is relatively rare, with an abundance of about 1.2 parts per million (ppm) in the Earth's crust. It is found in minerals such as monazite and xenotime, often occurring alongside other rare earth elements.</dd>

        <dt>Characteristics:</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li>Silvery-white, lustrous, and soft metal, making it relatively easy to work with.</li>

        <dt>Health Effects:</dt>
        <dd>Terbium is considered slightly toxic if ingested and can be an irritant to the skin and eyes upon direct contact. Precautions should be taken when handling terbium compounds.</dd>

        <dt>Environmental Effects:</dt>
        <dd>Terbium itself does not pose a significant environmental threat under normal conditions. However, the extraction and processing of minerals containing terbium can have negative environmental impacts. These processes often involve the use of toxic substances and can generate radioactive waste, potentially contaminating the surrounding soil and water.</dd>
